  "informationDeutschlandtaktContent1": "The Deutschlandtakt is a concept for an integrated clock-facing timetable for the railways in Germany, similar to the timetable in Switzerland. Most importantly, this means that connections at hub stations are coordinated, reducing transfer times. This principle is applied to high-speed, long-distance and regional services.",
  "informationDeutschlandtaktContent2": "The concept was developed under the leadership of SMA und Partner AG on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport.",
  "informationDeutschlandtaktContent3": "In the process, numerous infrastructure projects were derived from the timetable: First, the timetable was constructed, then the infrastructure expansion projects needed for implementing the timetable were derived.",

The categorization is primarily based on the top speed of the trains and the frequency of the stops.",
  "trainCategoriesContent2": "Long-distance trains with a top speed of 230\u202fkm\u2060/\u2060h to 300\u202fkm\u2060/\u2060h",
  "trainCategoriesContent3": "Long-distance trains or fast regional trains with a top-speed of 160\u202fkm\u2060/\u2060h or 200\u202fkm\u2060/\u2060h. The routes are in part through-services of existing regional routes. The Deutschlandtakt makes no statements regarding the fare classification of the lines.",
  "trainCategoriesContent4": "Further subdivided into suburban trains (S), local trains (N), which usually stop at all stations outside of suburban railway networks, and limited-stop trains (E), which stop only at selected stations.",
